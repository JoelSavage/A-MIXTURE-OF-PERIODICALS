The internet or the social media is the right place as a groundbreaking interactive marketplace and also an essential tool for people to access information and services right?

By the influence of the social media, we can now see the world through our windows, and enjoy effective and quick communication if the one lives thousands of kilometers away, but alongside its many valuable resources, the social media is occupied by invincible brood of vipers, whose aim to make sure that you never reach the top, hateful contents, offensive materials, black heart and treacherous people known as social media friends.

Frankly speaking, I wasn’t aware that the social media has its dark sides until I started writing. In a society whereby, ‘birds of the same feathers flock together’ you are not accepted if you look different. If that group is saying that ‘blue’ colour is ‘black,’ you need to agree with them to stay in the group.

Jesus said, “the truth shall set you free,” but in this present generation, the truth will give you many worries, discomfort and create a lot of enemies for you. I have said over and over that I may live in Europe for many years, but holding European passport doesn’t change my way of thinking, culture and identity. I am hundred percent true born African and proud to be an African.

Since I’m an African, my writings will reflect on my culture and issues affecting the African continent, which many European and American journalists will not do. This what many have failed to realize. Thus, writing the truth about Aids and Ebola shouldn’t generate hatred, because I’m an African, not European or American.

There are hundreds of scientists in this world, who are aware that the viruses of Aids and Ebola were biologically prepared as bio-weapons and tested on Africans by the Americans, yet only one scientist, the Dutch Johan Van Dongen revealed the truth and it costs him dearly. After losing his job as lecturer in the university of Maastricht, he became an enemy and his profile was deleted for the social media ‘LinkedIn.’

European and American journalists write distasteful and degrading articles about Africa, yet when an African writer reveals their weaknesses, corruption, inefficiency, racism, hypocrisy and their devilish plans against Africa, then everyone becomes angry. Thousands of Europeans and American commit suicide daily, if an African writer suggests, Europeans and Americans should learn from Africa how they have survived persecutions, diseases long before the white man’s medicine were discovered, then everyone is angry.

Recently, in United Voice News Magazine, a journalist wrote ‘9 Out Of 10 Americans Would Perish Without Power For Over A Year If The Isis strikes.’ I pointed out that this is a total disgrace to Americans if they will depend on electricity current to survive, knowing that there are thousands of villagers in Africa, who have never enjoyed light before since they were born, yet they are the healthiest and happiest people on earth. From school, they learn, read and write with the help of only kerosene lanterns. The link: https://goo.gl/5pAAFF
